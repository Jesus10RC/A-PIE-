Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance and Encapsulation: Object Oriented Programming Principles, and Refactoring of Functions



With this code we will introduce the Principles of Object Oriented Programming (POO), which are the following:

    -Abstraction

    -Encapsulation

    -Polymorphism

    -Inheritance

Of these principles, only "**Inheritance**" will not be addressed for our code, which follows the route of using Asset Market Data for its Quantitative Analysis. By obtaining Graphic Visualizations, visualization of Databases, obtaining Returns and Risk Metrics.

We will start by creating a Function that is in charge of making the Graphical Visualization, making the main code cleaner. When a Quant Developer wants to have code automation algorithms that should NOT necessarily be viewed by a Quan User, he only creates `Functions` and `Classes` that store some of the code necessary for financial calculations, but that the User Quan is not going to use.
